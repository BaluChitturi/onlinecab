   <center><i> <a href="sedan.html"target="_blank" >SEDAN INTERCITY</a>Traditional four-door sedans aren't dead yet. Despite sales encroachment from the ever-more-popular crossover and SUV segments, sedans remain relevant and typically drive better than SUVs while delivering much better efficiency. At the affordable end of the market, subcompact and compact sedans such as the Hyundai Accent, new Honda Civic, Kia Rio, and Nissan Versa represent popular and more affordable family-car alternatives to SUVs and even some large sedans. Move up in size and price, and passenger cars such as the Tesla Model 3 EV, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, and Audi A8 deliver cachet and performance to match their roomier interiors and trunks.</i></br></center>

    <center><i><a href="suv.html" target="_blank">SUV</a>The SUV market is booming in the past decade. 
      Buying SUV is now a consumer trend not merely in our country but also across the globe. 
      If you are in the market for a good SUV for long-term use but hesitate on making the decision, here’s everything you should know about SUV cars in India including the SUV meaning, SUV car segments, SUV prices and beyond!.A sport utility vehicle (SUV) is a car classification that combines elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles, such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive.

      There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of an SUV and usage of the term varies between countries. Thus, it is "a loose term that traditionally covers a broad range of vehicles with four-wheel drive."[1] Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a light truck chassis; however, broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV. A crossover SUV is often defined as an SUV built with a unibody construction (as with passenger cars); however, the designations are increasingly blurred because of the capabilities of the vehicles, the labelling by marketers, and electrification of new models.
